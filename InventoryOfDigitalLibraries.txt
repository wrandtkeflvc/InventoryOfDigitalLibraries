====Coral Gables Virtual History====
* '''URL for public viewing:'''  http://maps.fiu.edu/cgm/
* '''Description:''' 
** "Florida International University (FIU) has partnered with the City of Coral Gables to create a geospatially-enabled Virtual Historic City. With this tool, users may navigate to any point in the city at a selected time period (e.g. the Biltmore Hotel from the 1920s to 1940s), and experience the city as it was, through a wide variety of cultural artifacts and textual materials. A virtual walking tour of Coral Gables was also created, which includes an audio narration and 3D simulations providing the façade of historic buildings and landscape.  The target audience includes students, educators, historians, public policy administrators, business people, entrepreneurs, architects, sociologists, environmental analysts, urban planners, cultural heritage tourism, and the general public.  The digital archive hosts digitized and rectified maps, architectural drawings, property parcels, and aerial photographs. Currently, over 8,000 historical documents, photographs, oral histories, and maps have been spatially registered to their relevant locations and time."

Over 3,500 separate collections are included to date, many of which have associated images. We present here primary collections data. Other data on natural history collections for the Department of Ucayali have been compiled, but are not presented at this time. We hope to make this data available as part of a Ucayali Collections dataset, as time and resources permit. It is hoped that this data will contribute to the exchange of scientific information, and will enhance our knowledge of, and appreciation for, the complex of species, habitats, communities, ecosystems and ecoregions of Amazonia."

====Unearthing St. Augustine's Colonial Heritage====
* '''URL for public viewing:'''  http://maps.fiu.edu/saug/
* '''Description:''' 
** "The University of Florida (UF) has partnered with the City of St. Augustine to "unearth" archival repositories which have been previously inaccessible to researchers worldwide.  The digital archive supports research in a broad range of subjects: Florida and U.S. history, Spanish colonies, Native Americans, slavery, exploration, architecture and urban planning, social and economic development, missionary work, military defenses and warfare.  Currently, over 25,000 photographs, maps, overlays of the city, architectural drawings, government records, transcriptions of key Spanish documents, and archaeology site summaries have been digitized, with a majority of them geo-located. The collection not only satisfies the needs of a wide variety of researchers including historians, archaeologists, architects, historic preservationists, and those in the digital humanities, but the project also helps in telling St. Augustine's unique "story" of colonial heritage on a global scale.  FIU GIS Center partnered with UF libraries to create this interactive web interface for this digital archive collection."

The data sets collected for 2005 include bio-geo-chemical (including mercury and hydro period), fish, invertebrate, periphyton, and plant data. Each sampling site is associated with a location, a description of the site to provide a general overview and photographs to provide a pictorial impression. The Geographic Information Systems Center (GIS Center) at Florida International University (FIU) has designed and implemented an enterprise database for long-term storage of the project's data in a central repository, providing the framework of data storage for the continuity of future sampling campaigns and allowing integration of new sample data as it becomes available. In addition GIS Center provides this interactive web application for easy, quick and effective retrieval and visualization of that data."

===Riches of Central Florida:  Regional Initiative for Collecting the History, Experiences and Stories of Central Florida===
* '''URL for public viewing:'''  https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu/omeka2/
* '''Description:''' 
** "This project builds on the recognition that businesses and local business people constitute the building blocks of our community. It focuses on collecting and archiving oral histories of Central Florida businesses. In addition, the project will collect documents such as diaries, letters, advertisements, and other materials. The project concentrates on businesses that have been in the area for more than fifty years. We also seek materials and information on businesses that once were important in Central Florida but no longer exist. In addition to students and scholars, Building Blocks will aid policy makers, business people, entrepreneurs, and other groups interested in the Central Florida community.  The information collected in the Building Blocks project will be made available through Central Florida Mosaic Interface that will visually demonstrate the role of business in our region's history. It will provide viewers with maps from various periods of Central Florida history, with pop-up features for towns, roads, railroads, and some larger farms. When viewers click onto the pop-up, they will see images of the firms or farms in that area and read about the types of businesses that comprised the town. Excerpts from diaries that highlight the town or the business, business records, and oral histories will complete each popup. By clicking on maps from various eras, the viewer will be able to see economic change over time.  This project is historical, but it promises to have importance for both the present and the future. Community organizations will be able to link to the website from their own. It can become a component of business and development presentations, conveying a sense of a specific location and its social and economic history. Teachers will be able to use the site in their classrooms and for research projects. In ways like these, Building Blocks will use the past as a way for planning and thinking about how we got here, where we are now, and where we are headed in the future."  - from http://riches.cah.ucf.edu/buildingblocks.php

** "The purpose of STARS is to disseminate, publicize, and share works by, for, and about UCF. The intention is to provide access to this work as broadly as possible, and for as long as possible.  Join Us!  The repository is open to all faculty, staff, students and affiliates of UCF. Any UCF college, unit, department, lab, center, or institute is eligible to join. Student submissions may be subject to approval by the STARS coordinator in conjunction with a sponsoring faculty member.  While content does not have to be authored by UCF faculty, students, or staff to be included in STARS, there does need to be an UCF affiliation. For example, a unit may use STARS to post papers from a conference they sponsored, which may include some UCF authors and many from other institutions. All that is required is that the sponsoring UCF unit decides that it is appropriate for their part of STARS." - from http://stars.library.ucf.edu/about.html

(The OAI-PMH ListSets request shows that the Digital Library of the Caribbean and UFDC are sharing the same backend and both respond with the same set of collections.)
* There are many Herbarium images at http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/herbarium/cat/imagesearch.asp .  Is there a way to get metadata for these?
* Digital Library of the Caribbean will be listed separately as a significant multi-institutional site.
* You also have material in Florida OJ, and those journals will be listed separately in the report.

* '''Significant collections:''' 
** Bernard Diedrich Collection / Haiti Sun Newspaper Collection:  "As a well-traveled journalist, Bernard Diederich witnessed and even participated in countless events important to Caribbean and Central American history. His papers and media collection will thus provide invaluable sources to those who are interested in history, political science, international relations, and journalism, especially those who would like to learn more about Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, and Cuba, where Diederich worked for more than fifty years. The Haiti Sun Newspaper collection is digitized and part of the dLOC collection."
** Caribbean Maps:  "Maps collected here date from 1564 through the present. The majority of maps in this collection document a colonial past. While many of these maps were originally published as maps independent of any other publication, some were published with atlases, books, government documents, shipping and railroad schedules, land promotions, etc. Maps in this collection include island, municipal, county and parish maps as well as maps depicting the region more broadly.  The dLOC Caribbean Map Collection outlines a vast inter-continental region. The Caribbean Basin is defined to include the area stretching from Florida westward along the Gulf Coast waters of the United States of America, along the backbone of Central America and across the sholder of northern South America. The Basin is best defined by the sweeping archipelago that is the West Indies, an arm embracing the Caribbean Sea and the sieve of Atlantic hurricanes. Bound by colonial history, Bermuda is encluded within region, though it is situated in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean."
** Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library:  "A cooperative digital library for newspapers resources from the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean. CNDL provides access to digitized versions of Caribbean newspapers, gazettes, and other research materials on newsprint currently held in archives, libraries, and private collections. CNDL continues to add historical and current newspapers through ongoing digitization and born-digital curation, expanding the geographic, temporal, political and linguistic variety of the newspapers."  "CNDL began in July 2009 when the Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library was awarded a prestigious four year TICFIA grant, with the project starting in October 2009 to build the Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library (CNDL). The grant funding helped the Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library (CNDL) to be established a collaborative international digital newspaper library to preserve and increase access to valuable resources for the study of the Caribbean and the advancement of Caribbean Studies. CNDL is an umbrella for regional newspaper digitization including literary news journals, traditional newspapers, government gazettes, and other works in newsprint. The project partners have created a critical mass of endangered resources to enable access for researchers and the world."
** Caribbean Festival of Arts (CARIFESTA):  "The Caribbean Festival of Arts (CARIFESTA) is a roving multi-disciplinary art festival which has been held in various CARICOM countries since its establishment in 1972. It is  a regional forum where artists, performers and  other  persons in the  field of  culture meet and  exchange  ideas through presentations  of  music, dance, drama, exhibitions on art, sculpture, poetry and  symposia, among others. The CARICOM Secretariat through the Council on Human and Social Development (COHSOD) has since been involved not only in the shaping and preservation of CARIFESTA but also in promoting a coordinated approach to cultural policy development as embodied in the CARICOM Regional Cultural Policy endorsed by the Caribbean Community in 1994."  "The Collection includes consultants’ and country reports, articles extracted from  magazines, correspondence, press releases, information leaflets, presentations at  Symposia, programmes, various CARIFESTA themes; posters, photographs and  newspaper clippings."
** 19th Century Cuban Imprints:  "The 19th Century Cuban Imprints Digital Collection includes  early imprints on Cuba’s colonial past, efforts for self-governance, slavery, nationalism, foreign investment, crime, women’s rights, spirituality, popular culture and human rights. A number of these are truly unique items, and have been identified as such by special review as part of the Social Science Research Council Cuba Libro project: see link for details: http://www.ssrc.org/pages/digitization-initiative-for-cuban-19th-century-publishing/."
** Braga Brothers Collection:  "The Braga Brothers Collection is the gift of George Atkinson Braga and B. Rionda Braga to the University of Florida's George A. Smathers Libraries. Donated to the Libraries' Department of Special Collections in 1981, the collection is one of the richest archival sources on the modernization and expansion of the Cuban sugar industry. As the archive of a large North American company that did business in Cuba it provides insights to the unique commercial relationship that once existed between Cuba and the United States. The collection is, as well, an unavoidable historical source on topics pertaining to the social and political aspects of sugar production in pre-Castro Cuba."  "The collection consists primarily of administrative correspondence - letters, memoranda, and cables. Production data and records related to the technology employed in the manufacture of raw sugar, molasses, alcohol, and other cane products are evident as well. Ledgers and other accounting books, blueprints, and maps are also found in the collection. The latter includes original maps of the sugar estates and aerial photographic surveys of the Francisco and Manati sugar mills."
** Efrain Barradas Mexican and Cuban Film Posters Collection:  "In the Fall of 2008, Ramón Figueroa, Associate Professor of Spanish at Millsaps College in Mississippi, donated his personal collection of Mexican and Cuban film posters to the University of Florida Smathers Libraries Popular Culture Collection, in honor of Efraín Barradas (LAS/Spanish and Portuguese Studies), his former professor and friend. Due to Figueroa’s gift, UF now holds the largest public collection of Mexican movie posters in the United States. In February 2009, a $4500 mini-grant was received for conservation, digitization and metadata creation for the collection."
** Eric Eustace Williams Memorial Collection:  "The Eric Eustace Williams materials in the Digital Library of the Caribbean include a bibliography and a growing body of works by and about Dr. Williams, the first Prime Minister of the Trinidad and Tobago and often called the "Father of the Nation." Dr. Williams' importance as an historic figure in the Caribbean, indeed in North America and within the British Commonwealth, however, is as much as a philosopher as a politician. The works collected here should provide the researcher with the raw materials to study how he married his academic and political pursuits and how the character of the man fostered independence throughout the Caribbean. The works listed and collected here include Dr. William's many monographs and essays, together with his political speeches and other published works. Also included here is a characterization of Dr. Williams' political life as reported by the Trinidad Guardian."
** Gay Freedom Movement in Jamaica:  The Gay Freedom Movement in Jamaica (GFM) was formed in 1974 as the first movement in the English Speaking Caribbean to seek rights for LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered) people.  General Secretary, Larry Chang, who was also publisher and editor of JGN, was the first Jamaican to come out publicly.  These archives consist of the papers which relate to the work of the GFM which Mr Chang kept in his possession until he left Jamaica in 2000. The documents were kept by the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-sexuals and Gays (JFLAG).  The digitization of this archive was made possible through a City University of New York Diversity Grant. Special thanks to Stephanie Harvey, who organized and digitized the archive, and to Marianne LaBatto and the entire Brooklyn College Division of Archives & Special Collections, which facilitated that process.
** Haitian Law Digital Collection:  "The Haitian Law Digital Collection in the Digital Library of the Caribbean includes historic through current Haitian law documents and related international documents. Contributors to this collection include dLOC partners in Haiti and around the world, LLMC Digital and its partners for the Haiti Legal Patrimony Project, and others."
** Riots and Rebellions (Jamaica Unshackled):  The Riots and Rebellions is a digitized collection of resources from the National Library of Jamaica. Included in the Digital Library of the Caribbean are samples from the larger collection. The collection brings together resources related to two landmark events in Jamaica's history: the 1831 Sam Sharpe Rebellion / Baptist War (Books, Newspapers, Serials, Pamphlets, Official Documents, Maps, Photographs, Prints), and the 1865 Morant Bay Rebellion (Books, Newspapers, Serials, Official Documents, Maps, Photographs, Prints).  Funded in part by The Culture Health, Arts, Sports and Education Fund (CHASE), Riots and Rebellions is the first digital collection developed by the National Library of Jamaica.
** Maya Deren Collection:  The Maya Deren digital collection includes digitized recordings and letters by Maya Deren held in the University of Florida Libraries.  Digitized recordings of Haitian Voodoo music are shared from the UFDC's Vodou Archive.
** Panama and the Canal:  Panama and the Canal is a joint project from the University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries and the Panama Canal Museum. Panama and the Canal builds from the Panama Canal Museum's rich collection of Panama and Canal Zone materials and the extensive holdings on Panama and the whole of Latin America from the University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries' Latin American & Caribbean Collection, Government Documents Collection, and the Map & Imagery Library. The Government Documents Department of University of Florida Libraries is the Center of Excellence for the U.S. Panama Canal Commission and its predecessor agencies.
** Martin Rikli Photograph Collection:  The Martin Rikli Photograph Collection includes approximately 800 original images by Swiss documentary filmmaker Dr. Martin Rikli (1898-1969), taken on a voyage to and during his stay in Ethiopia during a German diplomatic and propaganda mission in the 1930s. The collection documents defensive military preparations in Addis Ababa, the capital, prior to and during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (also known as the Second Italo–Abyssinian War). Included are three photo albums, each entitled Abessinien 1935-1936, along with a fourth album of Rikli's handwritten contextual “Notes for Photograph Collection” (Anmerkungen Zur Lichtbildsammlung). These albums are accompanied by Rikli’s April 4, 1936 letter describing the situation in the capital, as well as a few miscellaneous items. The collection is particularly useful for research on mid-Twentieth Century Ethiopia, Ethiopian institutions such as the Coptic church, palace events and daily activities in the royal court, the European presence in Addis Ababa, military and diplomatic history, documentary photography, and visual history.
** Rafael Martínez Pupo Papers Relating to Comandos Mambises Collection:  The Rafael Martínez Pupo Papers Relating to Comandos Mambises Collection contains Martínez Pupo's correspondence with Cuban exiles, news agents, and government officials as well as expense reports, receipts and newspaper clippings from U.S. and Latin American newspapers of the commando's attacks on Cuban soil.
** Romero Family Papers Regarding José Marti:  The Romero Family Papers Regarding José Martí includes correspondence, photos, and mementos relating to the legacy of José Martí in Cuba. Almost all the correspondence is between María Mantilla de Romero and officials in Cuba. Much of the correspondence concerns the Centenario de Martí celebration in 1953. Dates of material range from 1875 to 1974, almost a full century. The bulk of the collection, however dates between 1953 and 1960. The correspondence is arranged chronologically. Particular items of interest include photocopies of letters to María Mantilla from José Martí.

=Significant Shared Collections=

'''Introduction:'''  Significant Shared Collections are sites which draw materials from multiple digital libraries listed in the Full Inventory.  This may be done by building a federated search.  For example, a significant shared collection might be a federated search of materials related to a single historical event or a specific topic, which locates materials about that event or topic from multiple digital libraries.  A significant shared collection might also store content contributed by multiple institutions.  

For each shared collection, information about contributors is provided.

Information on the history of the Publication of Archival, Library, and Museum Materials (PALMM) was collected using listserv archives available from University of Florida, and by using internal records from the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA).

==PALMM:  Publication of Archival Library and Museum Materials==

'''About the PALMM project'''

Publication of Archival, Library, and Museum Materials (PALMM) is an umbrella program supporting the cooperative building of shared collections using common standards and a shared infrastructure.

'''1999 - 2004: Start of the PALMM project'''

The PALMM project started in 1999 with a Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) federal grant distributed through the Members Council on Library Services (MCLS) Digital Initiatives Standing Committee (DISC) predecessor, the Digital Projects Planning Committee (DPPC).  Grants at up to around $7,000 annually were available to each university library each year from 1999 up to around 2004.  Each university library could nominate Florida materials from its own collections and then the DPPC approved funding for digitization and cataloging of those materials from a pool of Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant funding.  A university library could also partner with a museum, public library, or other entity, and in that way the university library could submit material from outside university holdings.  Once digitized, the materials went into PALMM collections.  At the start of the PALMM project, only UF and FIU had equipment for in house digitization, so almost all the university libraries sent materials to University of Florida along with entrusting the grant money to UF for digitization.  UF performed digitization on behalf of the universities, then returned original materials and digital copies to each university.  Also at this time, most university libraries had a limited web presence.  FCLA and UF libraries both had preexisting digital collections which were incorporated into PALMM.  At start of the PALMM project, FCLA moved from static webpages to DLXS, and PALMM materials were ingested into DLXS.

During this time period, the DISC predecessor was interested in keeping the number of PALMM collections to a minimum.  It was envisioned for discovery to all go through a single website, palmm.fcla.edu , in the form of outgoing links to collections.  A single website can only hold so many links before it's too long to skim.  As more collections went online, the website was kept trim by grouping similar collections into a concise set of top level collections.  So, for example, Florida Heritage Collection (FHP) was a catch all for many other collections contributed by several libraries.  If the palmm.fcla.edu homepage listing collections got cluttered, the DPPC would merge collections into one another, with one collection being a child collection to the other.

'''2004 - 2008: Continued growth of Florida digital collections'''

During this time period, university libraries began to start in house digitization programs.  Materials could be nominated for inclusion into PALMM.  In general, new materials were incorporated into existing PALMM collections according to a good fit of subject matter.  What is significant about this time period is that many libraries began in house digitization programs, and so no longer had to go through UF for digitization services.  Many vendors also began to offer fee based hosted digital library solutions, and libraries experimented with those.

'''2008 - 2012: Separation of collections across digital library platforms; Importance of discovery tools'''

In 2008, FCLA began migrating off DLXS.  Stand alone materials were migrated to Digitool, and serials were migrated to Open Journal Systems (Florida Online Journals).  Technology for digitization and digital libraries had become more widespread.  Many university libraries took the discontinuation of DLXS as opportunity to split off digital collections into various platforms other than Digitool.

Also, during this time period, there were advances in federated search across platforms.  Discovery tools for subscription resources reached a point of providing a good user experience.  Mango, the statewide discovery tool for cataloged library materials launched around 2010.  Metadata from digital collections can be harvested to Mango or other discovery tool through the OAI-PMH protocol.  The protocol was finalized in 2002, but discovery tools brought it to mainstream around 2010.  As libraries split off to separate collections, materials were not necessarily represented in discovery tools.  Digitool materials remained discoverable centrally through Mango, but other materials, including PALMM materials were no longer centrally discoverable.  Materials were centrally discoverable only if an OAI-PMH feed of metadata was available and the library submitted that feed for inclusion in Mango, or if the library comprehensively made local MARC records for digital materials.  In practice, this meant many of the PALMM materials were no longer centrally discoverable.

'''2012 - present: Statewide shared Islandora'''

In 2012, FCLA merged with the College Center for Library Automation (CCLA) to form the Florida Virtual Campus (FLVC).  At this time, a migration from Digitool to Islandora began.  Islandora had been selected as the statewide digital library platform after extensive discussion and analysis of digital library platforms.  During that discussion, Sobek had initially been selected, then rejected.  Sobek is open source software developed in house at UF library, and as of January 2016 used by Digital Library of the Caribbean (DLoC), UF, FIU (and The Wolfsonian Museum at FIU), USF, New College, Gulf Coast State College, and Seminole State College of Florida.

Many historical PALMM collections exist today on separate library websites.  These collections are not comprehensively indexed for federated search.  The statewide discovery tool Mango can ingest OAI-PMH records, and libraries are encouraged to submit feeds, but inclusion is not comprehensive.  Additionally, a common route to inclusion in Mango is that libraries can create a MARC record for a digital item in the local catalog and the item will show up in Mango in that way.

Islandora has functionality to provide metadata as an OAI-PMH feed.  It does not have functionality to harvest metadata as an OAI-PMH feed.  As of 2016, there are no plans to ingest metadata only records into Islandora, but rather all objects in Islandora are to have both content and metadata.  In fall 2015, a PALMM site launched in Islandora.  This site does not hold content, and instead pulls content from university instances of PALMM.  For example, FSU Libraries materials at http://fsu.digital.flvc.org/ which are shared to PALMM Islandora will show up at http://palmm.digital.flvc.org/ .  For libraries not using Islandora, a non public Islandora website was set up to hold PALMM materials.  In those cases, the university Islandora site is non-public, and is used to house materials that are shared with the PALMM Islandora site.  Then materials are made public through the PALMM Islandora site.

The palmm.fcla.edu site served as a central point of access beginning in the early 2000s.  As of 2016, that site is still live and open to the public.  It has outgoing links to PALMM collections.  It is static HTML.  If a PALMM collection which was once in a single digital library platform in the early 2000s is today in two separate digital library platforms, the link for that collection will only go to one of those platforms and will generally go to the one with a higher item count.  One result of the proliferation of separate platforms for digital collections is that far fewer collections have items contributed by multiple universities.  In the early 2000s, the norm in PALMM was for multiple libraries to contribute to a single larger collection.  In 2016, the norm in PALMM is that most collections have items contributed by a single library only.

* '''Description:''' 
** FLVC hosted Islandora site containing an interface for PALMM collections stored in FLVC hosted Islandora sites.  Some collections pull from FLVC hosted Islandora sites which are not open to the public.  For example, FIU, UF, and UNF all have private FLVC hosted Islandora sites in order to share digital objects to this PALMM site.  
** "Publication of Archival, Library, & Museum Materials (PALMM) is a cooperative initiative of the public universities and colleges of Florida to provide digital access to important source materials for research and scholarship. PALMM projects may involve a single university or college or may be collaborative efforts between a university or college and partners within or outside of the state university system. PALMM projects create high-quality virtual collections relevant to the students, research community and general citizenry of Florida."

** Static HTML page containing a directory of PALMM collections in various digital libraries across the state.  This is not a full listing of PALMM collections.  Instead, it is a listing of a subset of PALMM collections selected by a statewide committee for presentation on the PALMM homepage.  Initially, in the early 2000s, collections had been hosted in a far smaller number of digital libraries, and this webpage was intended as an attractive entry point.  Someone clicking into any collection would have had access to additional PALMM collections.

===Complete Listing of PALMM Collections===

'''Description:''' The PALMM project is a long running cooperative digitization project across Florida public university libraries.  It began in 1999.  Collections were selected by a statewide committee.  A collection could be nominated for digitization as part of the PALMM project, or an electronic collection could be nominated for inclusion.  Below is a comprehensive list of PALMM collections gathered from internal FCLA/FLVC documents, postings from committee listservs, and from old webpages and publications about the PALMM project.
