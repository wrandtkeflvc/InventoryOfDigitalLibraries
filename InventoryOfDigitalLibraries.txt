The goal was to promote collaborations across generes by inviting participants to produce literary broadsheets. In this manner The SWEAT Portfolio was formed. The theme is an homage to Sweat Records (the shop in Little Haiti where the first meeting was held), a reference to South Florida's tropical climate, a noun and a verb, and was open to interpretation. Some writers worked with several artists, some artists with multiple writers. In the end, forty-six artists and forty-two writers participated in SWEAT.

Howard was born in New York City in 1840 to an influential East Coast family, young Jarvis Howard served in the Union Army and managed with his father a newspaper that later became The New York Times. He was 35 years old with a wife and three children when he decided to join his brother in the Florida wilds.

Founded by Dr. Cyrus Teed, a former Civil War surgeon who later translated his name to the Hebrew version, Koresh, the Koreshan Unity was a faith-based group first established in Chicago. Teed's intention was to create a permanent residence, which was later constructed in Southwest Florida. Located in Estero, the commune quickly grew into a self-reliant township complete with a functioning economy and source of electricity. In 1961, the remaining members donated the land site to the State of Florida for historic preservation."
** Minnie L. Gatewood Diaries:  "Minnie L. Gatewood (1875-1944), who married a minister when she was 16 years old, kept diaries chronicling her life in Southwest Florida. The five volumes of her diary cover her life from 1892 to 1900, and are a valuable resource for scholars of Florida history. Mrs. Gatewood also kept a "Want Book" - mostly reflections on religious matters such as "Christian stewardship" - with the latest dated entry being from 1936. Mrs. Gatewood wrote mainly of her travels and family life, and her role as a minister's wife. Her husband, the Rev. George W. Gatewood (1862-1947), published On Florida's Coconut Coasts, in 1944. Their granddaughter, Hazel Hoffman Wall's autobiography Cracker Girl; A Love Story, published in 2006 includes stories of growing up with the Gatewoods in Southwest Florida."

** Southwest Florida Environmental Collection:  "The Southwest Florida Environmental Collection (SWFE), comprising the Estero Bay Documents Collection, the Charlotte Harbor Information Resource Center Documents Collection, and the Caloosahatchee Documents Collection contains recent and historical scientific information related to the environment of Southwest Florida, the Caloosahatchee River, and its watershed. Reports, surveys, monographs, and other materials from agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are collected together with materials from local agencies such as the South Florida Water Management District, the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program, the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District, the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council, and local consulting and engineering firms. These collections were made possible in part through grants generously provided by the Charlotte Harbor National Estuary Program and the South Florida Water Management District for the benefit of scientists, researchers, and planners working in Southwest Florida and has since also proven valuable to students interested in the biology, geology, and environment of the area."
** Uncommon Friends Collection:  "James D. Newton (1905-1999) was a prominent twentieth century entrepreneur and author of Uncommon Friends: Life with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Harvey Firestone, Alexis Carrel, and Charles Lindbergh, which recounts his friendship with these visionary figures. The Uncommon Friends Foundation, established in 1993 and named after Newton's memoir, is dedicated to lifelong character building among today's youth and business leaders, and the historic preservation of James D. Newton's papers, photographs, and artifacts in the City of Fort Myers. The Foundation and collection reside in the Burroughs Home (1901), located in the historic district of Fort Myers, Florida. In 2012, the Uncommon Friends Foundation and Florida Gulf Coast University Library partnered to digitally preserve and provide public access to this captivating collection of materials."
** William R. Maples Collection:  "Dr. William R. Maples (1937-1997) was a world renown forensic anthropologist, who oversaw the C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory at the Florida Museum of Natural History. The digital collection includes images and documents pertaining to his many high profile cases, including the identification of the real skeleton of Francisco Pizarro, whose bones were thought to be safely tucked away in a crypt for over 80 years. After many months of persistent requests, a Zachary Taylor fanatic, with the blessing of the Taylor family, got Maples to examine the bones of the twelfth president to see if there were signs of arsenic poisoning, pointing to an assassination. Due to his notoriety in the field, Maples was also granted permission to study the skeleton of Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, whose body was a scientific anomaly during his life and continues to captivate contemporary audiences. Maples most famous investigations revolves around the murders of the Romanov family, a mass execution in 1918, which was shrouded in mystery until the bodies were found a little over 70 years later. It would be Maples, who would finally identify the skeletons and allow them to be put to rest."

Perry collection, held in the FIU Special Collections and University Archives."  "Charles Edward Perry (Chuck), 1937-1999, was the founding president of Florida International University in Miami. He grew up in Logan County, West Virginia and graduated from Bowling Green State University. He married Betty Laird in 1961. In 1969, at the age of 32, Perry was the youngest president of any university in the nation. The name of the university reflects Perry’s desire for a title that would not limit the scope of the institution and would support his vision of having close ties to Latin America. Perry and a founding corps opened FIU to 5,667 students in 1972 with only one large building housing six different schools. Perry left the office of President of FIU in 1976 when the student body had grown to 10,000 students and the university had six buildings, offered 134 different degrees and was fully accredited. Charles Perry died on August 30, 1999 at his home in Rockwall, Texas. He is buried on the FIU campus in front of the Graham Center entrance."

Opened to the public in 1995, The Wolfsonian has received wide recognition among scholars, collectors, educators, the media, museum professionals, and visitors for its unrivaled collection of modern material culture and its multidisciplinary approach to looking at objects as both agents and expressions of change. While these objects can best be understood in the context in which they were created, they illuminate as much about our times as they reveal about their own. The museum supports scholarship and develops and disseminates critically acclaimed exhibitions, publications, and educational programs that highlight the impact of design in shaping the modern world."

* '''Description:''' 
** "The University of Florida (UF) has partnered with the City of St. Augustine to "unearth" archival repositories which have been previously inaccessible to researchers worldwide.  The digital archive supports research in a broad range of subjects: Florida and U.S. history, Spanish colonies, Native Americans, slavery, exploration, architecture and urban planning, social and economic development, missionary work, military defenses and warfare.  Currently, over 25,000 photographs, maps, overlays of the city, architectural drawings, government records, transcriptions of key Spanish documents, and archaeology site summaries have been digitized, with a majority of them geo-located. The collection not only satisfies the needs of a wide variety of researchers including historians, archaeologists, architects, historic preservationists, and those in the digital humanities, but the project also helps in telling St. Augustine's unique "story" of colonial heritage on a global scale.  FIU GIS Center partnered with UF libraries to create this interactive web interface for this digital archive collection."

The Pepper Photograph Collection includes personal photos from Winston Churchill, Franklin D. & Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, and John F. Kennedy among other well-known U.S. and international dignitaries.

Banks (1866 –1945) acquired a magnificent collection of ancient inscribed Babylonian clay tablets which illustrate the oldest of writings. They are mostly temple records and business documents dating from over 4000 years ago. In 1922, Dr. Josiah Bethea Game (1869-1935) negotiated the purchase of twenty-five tablets for the Florida State College for Women (FSCW). The tablets range in size from one to two square inches, and are square, rounded and cone shaped."
*** Edward Lear's Book of Nonsense:  "Edward Lear was a British poet and painter. Although he wrote many poetry volumes and travel journals, he is best known for his Book of Nonsense, first published in 1846, which consists of drawings and short poems he wrote for the grandchildren of Lord Derby. While he is not credited as the inventor of the limerick, the poems of the Book of Nonsense would be defined as such today. This online collection includes the multiple editions of the Book of Nonsense published from 1846 to 1880. It also includes the many derivitive editions and works which call the Book of Nonsense their inspiration. Our Edward Lear collection belongs in the John M. Shaw Childhood in Poetry collection. John MacKay Shaw (1897-1984) was an AT&T Executive who began collecting related to childhood in the 1930s. From this hobby the collection grew. Following his retirement in 1959, Shaw gave his collection of almost 6,000 volumes to Florida State University Libraries. For the next 25 years, Shaw went to Strozier Library daily to study, write, and talk about his books. The Shaw Collection has grown immensely over the years and it currently comprises over 35,000 volumes and 69 linear feet of archival material."
*** FSU Lives: Portal to the Past, Prologue to the Future:  "The Florida State University has a long and illustrious history dating back to the legislation creating it in 1851. Through its many names, Seminary West of Suwannee, Florida Female College, Florida State College for Women (FSCW) and The Florida State University (FSU), its students identified themselves with its history and made history, both individually and collectively as members of its classes. On the occasion of their 50th reunion, the Class of 1955 gave a unique gift, joining the content of the university’s past with the possibilities in digital technology, creating FSU Lives: Portal to the Past, Prologue to the Future, a digital look of life at FSU during the 1950s. This collection pulls from various holdings in Special Collections and includes yearbooks, President's Reports, and select publications, photographs and documents created for and by FSU faculty, students and staff during the 1950s."

**** Art on Campus:  "Art at FSU during the 1950s was a particularly thriving area of campus life. From performances held by students of the Schools of Music, Dance and Theatre to the campus Art Gallery and a continuing series of performances brought to FSU, art was an important component to a student’s experience during this era."
***** Art Gallery:  "Now the Museum of Fine Arts at Florida State University, the original art gallery was founded in 1950. It occupied a small room at its inception and was staffed by volunteer faculty and had no dedicated funding."
***** Artist Series:  "The Artist Series brings cultural entertainment to FSU’s campus. It was founded with the idea that a university, in order to provide a balanced intellectual environment, cannot be about only instruction and recreation. These materials reflect the Artist Series offerings in the late 1950s."

*** Historical Newspapers:  "This collection holds newspaper issues from various titles from a period of the 17th century to the 20th century. The majority of the collection is focused on newspapers from the American southeast. Several different physical collections contribute to the digital collection."
*** Il Secolo:  "This collection holds a nine month run of the Italian newspaper Il Secolo, a 4 page political daily that introduced many technological and thematic innovations in Italian journalism. Founded in 1866 by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno, in the space of a decade it became the most widely read national daily across the country, reaching print runs of up to 300,000 copies during the 1870s and 1880s. Eclipsed in readership and in political relevance by the 1890s by the Corriere della sera, it ceased to exist in 1925. Access is provided for nine months of Il Secolo, January-September 1885, as a sample for a forthcoming redigitization of the content."
*** John House Stereograph Collection:  "The collection bears the name of the British art historian who collected it over a period of more than four decades, John House (1945-2012). The collection, acquired for the FSU Department of Art History by Jennifer S. Pride as part of Professor House’s estate, represents the late scholar’s efforts to establish a digital database of stereoscopic views available to scholars worldwide.  House’s carefully curated collection comprises nearly 2,000 views of nineteenth-century Paris. This unique collection serves as primary visual documents of Paris before, during, and after Napoleon III and Baron George-Eugene Haussmann’s extreme urban renewal project, known as Haussmannization (1853-70). These online materials highlight the premier status of the Florida State University program in Art History, one of the oldest and highest ranked programs in the Southeast. The collection provides archival objects that complement our specialized curricula in Modern European Art, Architecture, and Urbanism, History of Photography, and Museum and Cultural Heritage Studies."
*** Juvenile Literature:  "This collection pulls from several different collections such as the John M. Shaw Collection overall, the Shaw Childhood in Poetry Collection, and various other childhood literature collections at FSU. These books look at the experience of childhood through stories, poetry, songs and illustrations particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries."
*** Napoleonic Collections:  "The French Revolution and Napoleon Collection at Florida State University holds over 20,000 rare titles from this period alongside numerous manuscript and record collections. It was established in the early 1960s as the Department of History expanded its offerings in that particular period of history by establishing the Institute on Napoleon & the French Revolution. Florida State University, through the Department of History and the Institute, provides the only graduate program in the United States devoted to the historical study of this time period."
**** French Revolution Collection on Camille Desmoulins, Lucile Duplesis, and Arthur Dillon, 1702-1876:  "This collection focuses on the French Revolutionary period in France.

**** Le Moniteur universel:  "Founded in Paris in 1789 by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke under the title Gazette Nationale, ou Le Moniteur Universel, this publication was the main French newspaper during the French Revolution and was the long time official journal for the French government. In designing his newspaper, Panckoucke followed the format of English papers at the time and divided his paper into five main sections: The National Assembly, Domestic and Foreign Policy, Administration, Literature, Science and Arts, and General Announcements and Notes. The paper would become less political over time, publishing more articles on literature, science and art by 1811. It also dropped Gazette Nationale from its title in January of 1811 and became simply Le Moniteur Universel. Our collection of Le Moniteur Universel starts with the 1789 issues and goes through the end of 1830. It includes the published indices from 1815-1829."
*** Papyri & Ostraka
** Paul A.M. Dirac Collection:  "Paul Dirac is recognized by most authorities as one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the twentieth century and father of the field of quantum mechanics. He was the youngest person ever to win the Nobel Prize when he shared the 1933 prize for discoveries in atomic theory with Erwin Schroedinger. The Paul A.M. Dirac Collection consists of selected materials that were digitized from the original Dirac Papers. The digital collection contains lectures, documents including Dirac's PhD dissertation, photos, formulas, awards given to Dirac, and other historical objects."
*** Poetry during World War I:  "This collection of books of poetry published during the years of World War I are from the John MacKay Shaw Childhood in Poetry collection. They were selected from a bibliography that covers 360 poetry books and young adult magazines produced in Great Britain and North America during the Great War and collected by Shaw for inclusion in his larger poetry collection. As the bibliography notes, Dr. Shaw’s tastes in poetry were “formed when Kipling and Hardy were very much in fashion,” so many of the authors included here are not well known to today’s readers but share a unique look into the first World War and those who experienced it, whether on the Western Front or the home front."
*** Ringling Museum Circus Herald Collection: "The Ringling Museum Herald Collection comes from the holdings of The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art collection. Heralds were a popular form of advertisement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Circuses used clever language and images to proclaim the arrival of a show. The Ringling Museum’s Circus Herald Collection includes nearly 300 show titles, including Barnum & Bailey, Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey, Al G. Barnes, Cole Bros, Forepaugh-Sells, and highlights performances around the United States and Europe."

* '''Significant collections:''' 
** Florida Historical Quarterly:  The Florida Historical Quarterly, the academic journal of the Florida Historical Society, promotes scholarly research and appreciation for the peoples, places, themes, and diversity of Florida's past. The Society is the oldest cultural institution in the state, tracing its origins to 1856. The Quarterly has served to expand understanding of Florida's historical development and offers a broad spectrum of articles. Published four times annually, the Quarterly continues the tradition of high quality scholarly articles established and maintained by the Society. The Quarterly has been a central component of the mission of the Florida Historical Society to promote scholarly research and publication. Students, researchers, and casual readers may use the collection liberally, although reproduction of materials for use outside of classrooms must be approved by the Society.
** PRISM: Political & Rights Issues & Social Movements:  PRISM: Political & Rights Issues & Social Movements, a collaborative digitization project of the libraries and special collections departments of Florida Atlantic University (FAU), and the University of Central Florida (UCF), is composed of materials focusing on a wide range of political and rights issues and social movements which provide insight into the prevailing leftist and liberal views of the times from countries all around the world; from the United States to Korea and India to Canada.  UCF's contributions focus on a collection of political pamphlets on socialism and communism collected by Miss Van Sickle, a staunch Canadian Socialist from the 1920s through the 1970s. Topics covered in the pamphlets include liberal or leftist causes from the time period collected such as: world pacifism, anti-racism, anti-Semitism, British and world labor movements, communism, socialism, women's rights, and the "ban-the-bomb" movement. Many of the items in the collection are extremely rare, and possibly unique to the UCF collection. Over 2,000 pamphlets have been catalogued and can be searched using the library's Online Catalog or by clicking here. Another 150 pamphlets are uncatalogued and can be searched using the Uncataloged Van Sickle Pamphlets Guide.
** UCF Special Collections:
*** Floridiana:  UCF's Floridiana collection comprises a variety of books, manuscripts, maps and ephemera all relating to the state of Florida, particularly the Central Florida region.
**** UCF Florida Heritage:  "This collection contains UCF's contributions to the Florida Heritage Collection, an ongoing cooperative project of the State University System (SUS) of Florida to digitize and provide online access to materials broadly representing Florida's history, culture, arts, literature, sciences and social sciences. Thematic areas in this growing collection include Native American and minority populations, exploration and development, tourism, the natural environment, and regional interests. Materials are taken from archives, special collections, and libraries of the state universities. These materials represent only a small part of the wealth of historical and archival treasures held by the UCF Libraries."

In recognition of the sesquicentennial of the start of the American Civil War, Civil War in the American South provides a central portal to access digital collections from the Civil War Era (1850-1865) held by members of the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL).  ASERL members hold deep and extensive collections documenting the history and culture of the American South, developed over hundreds of years to support scholarly research and teaching. Many of the special or unique manuscripts, photographs, books, newspapers, broadsides, and other materials have been digitized to provide broader access to these documents for scholars and students around the world. Civil War in the American South is a collaborative initiative to provide a single, shared point of access to the Civil War digital collections held at many individual libraries."
** UCF's Community Veterans History Project:  "The UCF Community Veterans History Project is collecting, preserving, and making accessible to the public the experiences of Central Florida's veterans so that future generations will better understand the realities of conflict. It is a collaborative endeavor supported by multiple departments and offices at UCF. The UCF CVHP is a RICHES of Central Florida Project.  Diversity is a main focus for this project since there are many different subgroups under the group veterans, all with important stories. While the histories will be largely archived and made available through the UCF library, a portion will be contributed to the ongoing Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress."
** Central Florida Future:  "Semi-weekly student newspaper of the University of Central Florida (UCF). It started in 1968 upon the opening of Florida Technological University (FTU), UCF’s predecessor. Initially it was called “FuTUre” and published weekly. The words “Central Florida” were added around the time the school changed to UCF. It is available in microfilm (1968-1986, library call number LD1772.F9 A1438), online (September 2001-current, at http://www.centralfloridafuture.com) and in University Archives (1968-current)."
** Pegasus Yearbooks:  "The Pegasus 1970 yearbook was the first volume of its short run of seven, ending in 1982. A Silver Anniversary (25th) edition named The Knight was published in 1989 by UCF’s Student Government Association. Of special note is Pegasus 1971 which includes unique cover art, interesting staff photos, and a signed, limited edition print in every volume. There is also playful photography in the junior class portraits of Pegasus 1981."
** University Photograph Collection:  "Collection contains photographs that were taken for use as publicity material for the University of Central Florida. The images document all aspects of university life including annual events such as commencement and homecoming, special events, portraits of faculty, students, alumni, and visitors to the university including speakers, performers and government officials. Buildings on both the main campus and regional campuses are shown during construction and after completion. Instructors are shown teaching and researching and students are shown studying in laboratories and classrooms. A guide to the physical collection is available at University Photographs, 1965-2006."
** University Archives:  "The University Archives, housed with the Special Collections, holds publications, records, photographs and other materials on the University of Central Florida, formerly Florida Technological University from its beginnings in 1963 to the current day. Materials are selected, preserved, and made accessible for their enduring historical and administrative value to the University. These records may be paper-based, or in other formats such as photographs, audio, or film; they are appraised for their content."
** UCF Course Catalogs:  "Originally the Bulletin, the undergraduate catalog for Florida Technological University was printed each year, occasionally with supplements to reflect changes in curriculum or class offerings. For the academic year 1982-83, the first volume of the Graduate Catalog was printed and continues to be produced alongside the undergraduate version."
** Institute for Simulation and Training:  "Over 200 digitized IST documents are available electronically as PDF documents via the UCF Libraries' catalog. The hard copies are housed in the collection at the main branch of the UCF Libraries. Publications for digitization were drawn from the Institute for Simulation and Training's extensive collection of research related to modeling and simulation science. This unique compendium is supported in part by generous annual donations from G. Vincent Amico."
** Dick Pope Sr. Institute for Tourism Studies:  "This digital collection contains selected materials from the Dick Pope Sr. Institute for Tourism Studies. Publications for digitization were drawn from the Institute’s extensive collection of research for clients worldwide, covering an array of topics such as marketing, regional planning, event planning, and economic impact on a region."
** Electronic Theses and Dissertations:  "Graduate students began submitting Electronic Theses and Dissertations during the Spring semester of 2004. Electronic submission was optional until the Fall semester of 2004. To date, over 3,300 ETDs have been uploaded."
*** Retrospective Theses & Dissertations:  "The RTD (retrospective thesis or dissertation) collection contains electronic versions of theses and dissertations previously published only in print.  There are over 5,000 theses and dissertations that were published only in print, and therefore, reach a very limited audience.  The goal of this exciting project is to extend the reach of UCF’s graduate research publications. By receiving permission to digitize and post these works online, these works can be used by researchers around the world, showing the excellence of scholarship at the University of Central Florida since the first theses were published in 1972."
** Electronic Undergraduate Honors Theses:  "This collection contains records for Honors in the Major theses completed at UCF.  Links to electronic versions are included when available."

===Riches of Central Florida:  Regional Initiative for Collecting the History, Experiences and Stories of Central Florida===
* '''URL for public viewing:'''  https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu/omeka2/
* '''Description:''' 
** "This project builds on the recognition that businesses and local business people constitute the building blocks of our community. It focuses on collecting and archiving oral histories of Central Florida businesses. In addition, the project will collect documents such as diaries, letters, advertisements, and other materials. The project concentrates on businesses that have been in the area for more than fifty years. We also seek materials and information on businesses that once were important in Central Florida but no longer exist. In addition to students and scholars, Building Blocks will aid policy makers, business people, entrepreneurs, and other groups interested in the Central Florida community.  The information collected in the Building Blocks project will be made available through Central Florida Mosaic Interface that will visually demonstrate the role of business in our region's history. It will provide viewers with maps from various periods of Central Florida history, with pop-up features for towns, roads, railroads, and some larger farms. When viewers click onto the pop-up, they will see images of the firms or farms in that area and read about the types of businesses that comprised the town. Excerpts from diaries that highlight the town or the business, business records, and oral histories will complete each popup. By clicking on maps from various eras, the viewer will be able to see economic change over time.  This project is historical, but it promises to have importance for both the present and the future. Community organizations will be able to link to the website from their own. It can become a component of business and development presentations, conveying a sense of a specific location and its social and economic history. Teachers will be able to use the site in their classrooms and for research projects. In ways like these, Building Blocks will use the past as a way for planning and thinking about how we got here, where we are now, and where we are headed in the future."  - from http://riches.cah.ucf.edu/buildingblocks.php

** "The purpose of STARS is to disseminate, publicize, and share works by, for, and about UCF. The intention is to provide access to this work as broadly as possible, and for as long as possible.  Join Us!  The repository is open to all faculty, staff, students and affiliates of UCF. Any UCF college, unit, department, lab, center, or institute is eligible to join. Student submissions may be subject to approval by the STARS coordinator in conjunction with a sponsoring faculty member.  While content does not have to be authored by UCF faculty, students, or staff to be included in STARS, there does need to be an UCF affiliation. For example, a unit may use STARS to post papers from a conference they sponsored, which may include some UCF authors and many from other institutions. All that is required is that the sponsoring UCF unit decides that it is appropriate for their part of STARS." - from http://stars.library.ucf.edu/about.html

'''Questions for UF:'''
*  Is this a complete list of digital libraries for the university?
** http://ufdc.ufl.edu
** https://archive.org/details/UFRDS
** http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/36110
** http://orangegrovetexts.org
** http://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/
** https://archive.org/details/univ_florida_smathers
* For the UFDC, the breakdown of collections is taken by looking at a setSpec argument in OAI-PMH.  If you have an alternate listing of collections, feel free to suggest it.  (The OAI-PMH ListSets request shows that the Digital Library of the Caribbean and UFDC are sharing the same backend and both respond with the same set of collections.)
* There are many Herbarium images at http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/herbarium/cat/imagesearch.asp .  Is there a way to get metadata for these?
* Digital Library of the Caribbean will be listed separately as a significant multi-institutional site.
* You also have material in Florida OJ, and those journals will be listed separately in the report.

Digital collections draw special attention to the The Visionaires and the records of the Cunningham Funeral Home. The Visionaires Collection consists of minutes of The Visionaires' meetings, records of financial transactions, photographs, and materials that document the organization's participation in school and community activities.

Besides burial records, the collection contains photographs, financial transactions, oral histories, maps, letters, secretarial notes, political history, and notes on dress and life in Florida.  Most importantly, these records establish community demographics. Until the 1970s, the only comprehensive listing of African-American communities in any Florida county was found in morticians' records.  For instance, if a researcher wants to know where African-American churches and schools were located, that information can be found in the records.

They were truly the heart of the community."

** Bernard Diedrich Collection / Haiti Sun Newspaper Collection:  "As a well-traveled journalist, Bernard Diederich witnessed and even participated in countless events important to Caribbean and Central American history. His papers and media collection will thus provide invaluable sources to those who are interested in history, political science, international relations, and journalism, especially those who would like to learn more about Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, and Cuba, where Diederich worked for more than fifty years. The Haiti Sun Newspaper collection is digitized and part of the dLOC collection."
** Caribbean Maps:  "Maps collected here date from 1564 through the present. The majority of maps in this collection document a colonial past. While many of these maps were originally published as maps independent of any other publication, some were published with atlases, books, government documents, shipping and railroad schedules, land promotions, etc. Maps in this collection include island, municipal, county and parish maps as well as maps depicting the region more broadly.  The dLOC Caribbean Map Collection outlines a vast inter-continental region. The Caribbean Basin is defined to include the area stretching from Florida westward along the Gulf Coast waters of the United States of America, along the backbone of Central America and across the sholder of northern South America. The Basin is best defined by the sweeping archipelago that is the West Indies, an arm embracing the Caribbean Sea and the sieve of Atlantic hurricanes. Bound by colonial history, Bermuda is encluded within region, though it is situated in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean."
** Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library:  "A cooperative digital library for newspapers resources from the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean. CNDL provides access to digitized versions of Caribbean newspapers, gazettes, and other research materials on newsprint currently held in archives, libraries, and private collections. CNDL continues to add historical and current newspapers through ongoing digitization and born-digital curation, expanding the geographic, temporal, political and linguistic variety of the newspapers."  "CNDL began in July 2009 when the Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library was awarded a prestigious four year TICFIA grant, with the project starting in October 2009 to build the Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library (CNDL). The grant funding helped the Caribbean Newspaper Digital Library (CNDL) to be established a collaborative international digital newspaper library to preserve and increase access to valuable resources for the study of the Caribbean and the advancement of Caribbean Studies. CNDL is an umbrella for regional newspaper digitization including literary news journals, traditional newspapers, government gazettes, and other works in newsprint. The project partners have created a critical mass of endangered resources to enable access for researchers and the world."
** Caribbean Festival of Arts (CARIFESTA):  "The Caribbean Festival of Arts (CARIFESTA) is a roving multi-disciplinary art festival which has been held in various CARICOM countries since its establishment in 1972. It is  a regional forum where artists, performers and  other  persons in the  field of  culture meet and  exchange  ideas through presentations  of  music, dance, drama, exhibitions on art, sculpture, poetry and  symposia, among others. The CARICOM Secretariat through the Council on Human and Social Development (COHSOD) has since been involved not only in the shaping and preservation of CARIFESTA but also in promoting a coordinated approach to cultural policy development as embodied in the CARICOM Regional Cultural Policy endorsed by the Caribbean Community in 1994."  "The Collection includes consultants’ and country reports, articles extracted from  magazines, correspondence, press releases, information leaflets, presentations at  Symposia, programmes, various CARIFESTA themes; posters, photographs and  newspaper clippings."
** 19th Century Cuban Imprints:  "The 19th Century Cuban Imprints Digital Collection includes  early imprints on Cuba’s colonial past, efforts for self-governance, slavery, nationalism, foreign investment, crime, women’s rights, spirituality, popular culture and human rights. A number of these are truly unique items, and have been identified as such by special review as part of the Social Science Research Council Cuba Libro project: see link for details: http://www.ssrc.org/pages/digitization-initiative-for-cuban-19th-century-publishing/."
** Braga Brothers Collection:  "The Braga Brothers Collection is the gift of George Atkinson Braga and B. Rionda Braga to the University of Florida's George A. Smathers Libraries. Donated to the Libraries' Department of Special Collections in 1981, the collection is one of the richest archival sources on the modernization and expansion of the Cuban sugar industry. As the archive of a large North American company that did business in Cuba it provides insights to the unique commercial relationship that once existed between Cuba and the United States. The collection is, as well, an unavoidable historical source on topics pertaining to the social and political aspects of sugar production in pre-Castro Cuba."  "The collection consists primarily of administrative correspondence - letters, memoranda, and cables. Production data and records related to the technology employed in the manufacture of raw sugar, molasses, alcohol, and other cane products are evident as well. Ledgers and other accounting books, blueprints, and maps are also found in the collection. The latter includes original maps of the sugar estates and aerial photographic surveys of the Francisco and Manati sugar mills."
** Efrain Barradas Mexican and Cuban Film Posters Collection:  "In the Fall of 2008, Ramón Figueroa, Associate Professor of Spanish at Millsaps College in Mississippi, donated his personal collection of Mexican and Cuban film posters to the University of Florida Smathers Libraries Popular Culture Collection, in honor of Efraín Barradas (LAS/Spanish and Portuguese Studies), his former professor and friend. Due to Figueroa’s gift, UF now holds the largest public collection of Mexican movie posters in the United States. In February 2009, a $4500 mini-grant was received for conservation, digitization and metadata creation for the collection."
** Eric Eustace Williams Memorial Collection:  "The Eric Eustace Williams materials in the Digital Library of the Caribbean include a bibliography and a growing body of works by and about Dr. Williams, the first Prime Minister of the Trinidad and Tobago and often called the "Father of the Nation." Dr. Williams' importance as an historic figure in the Caribbean, indeed in North America and within the British Commonwealth, however, is as much as a philosopher as a politician. The works collected here should provide the researcher with the raw materials to study how he married his academic and political pursuits and how the character of the man fostered independence throughout the Caribbean. The works listed and collected here include Dr. William's many monographs and essays, together with his political speeches and other published works. Also included here is a characterization of Dr. Williams' political life as reported by the Trinidad Guardian."
** Gay Freedom Movement in Jamaica:  The Gay Freedom Movement in Jamaica (GFM) was formed in 1974 as the first movement in the English Speaking Caribbean to seek rights for LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered) people.  General Secretary, Larry Chang, who was also publisher and editor of JGN, was the first Jamaican to come out publicly.  These archives consist of the papers which relate to the work of the GFM which Mr Chang kept in his possession until he left Jamaica in 2000. The documents were kept by the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-sexuals and Gays (JFLAG).  The digitization of this archive was made possible through a City University of New York Diversity Grant. Special thanks to Stephanie Harvey, who organized and digitized the archive, and to Marianne LaBatto and the entire Brooklyn College Division of Archives & Special Collections, which facilitated that process.
** Haitian Law Digital Collection:  "The Haitian Law Digital Collection in the Digital Library of the Caribbean includes historic through current Haitian law documents and related international documents. Contributors to this collection include dLOC partners in Haiti and around the world, LLMC Digital and its partners for the Haiti Legal Patrimony Project, and others."
** Riots and Rebellions (Jamaica Unshackled):  The Riots and Rebellions is a digitized collection of resources from the National Library of Jamaica.

The collection brings together resources related to two landmark events in Jamaica's history: the 1831 Sam Sharpe Rebellion / Baptist War (Books, Newspapers, Serials, Pamphlets, Official Documents, Maps, Photographs, Prints), and the 1865 Morant Bay Rebellion (Books, Newspapers, Serials, Official Documents, Maps, Photographs, Prints).  Funded in part by The Culture Health, Arts, Sports and Education Fund (CHASE), Riots and Rebellions is the first digital collection developed by the National Library of Jamaica.
** Maya Deren Collection:  The Maya Deren digital collection includes digitized recordings and letters by Maya Deren held in the University of Florida Libraries.  Digitized recordings of Haitian Voodoo music are shared from the UFDC's Vodou Archive.
** Panama and the Canal:  Panama and the Canal is a joint project from the University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries and the Panama Canal Museum. Panama and the Canal builds from the Panama Canal Museum's rich collection of Panama and Canal Zone materials and the extensive holdings on Panama and the whole of Latin America from the University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries' Latin American & Caribbean Collection, Government Documents Collection, and the Map & Imagery Library. The Government Documents Department of University of Florida Libraries is the Center of Excellence for the U.S. Panama Canal Commission and its predecessor agencies.
** Martin Rikli Photograph Collection:  The Martin Rikli Photograph Collection includes approximately 800 original images by Swiss documentary filmmaker Dr. Martin Rikli (1898-1969), taken on a voyage to and during his stay in Ethiopia during a German diplomatic and propaganda mission in the 1930s. The collection documents defensive military preparations in Addis Ababa, the capital, prior to and during the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (also known as the Second Italo–Abyssinian War). Included are three photo albums, each entitled Abessinien 1935-1936, along with a fourth album of Rikli's handwritten contextual “Notes for Photograph Collection” (Anmerkungen Zur Lichtbildsammlung). These albums are accompanied by Rikli’s April 4, 1936 letter describing the situation in the capital, as well as a few miscellaneous items. The collection is particularly useful for research on mid-Twentieth Century Ethiopia, Ethiopian institutions such as the Coptic church, palace events and daily activities in the royal court, the European presence in Addis Ababa, military and diplomatic history, documentary photography, and visual history.
** Rafael Martínez Pupo Papers Relating to Comandos Mambises Collection:  The Rafael Martínez Pupo Papers Relating to Comandos Mambises Collection contains Martínez Pupo's correspondence with Cuban exiles, news agents, and government officials as well as expense reports, receipts and newspaper clippings from U.S. and Latin American newspapers of the commando's attacks on Cuban soil.

Dates of material range from 1875 to 1974, almost a full century. The bulk of the collection, however dates between 1953 and 1960. The correspondence is arranged chronologically. Particular items of interest include photocopies of letters to María Mantilla from José Martí.
** Vodou Archive:  The Archive of Haitian Religion and Culture: Collaborative Research and Scholarship on Haiti and the Haitian Diaspora will create a freely accessible multimedia digital library that uses audiovisual technologies to curate, elucidate and facilitate the advanced search of the rich primary materials of a central Haitian and Haitian-American spiritual tradition in order to promote discovery and educate a broad public.

** The Civil War in Florida:  Known as “the smallest tadpole in the dirty pool of secession,” Florida was the third state to secede from the United States during the American Civil War. Among the Confederate states, Florida possessed the lowest population yet provided critical resources in the form of beef and salt. Florida’s economy during Reconstruction was depressed, and African Americans struggled for access to education and political office.

** Spanish Colonial Florida:  In the colonial period, Florida, although a Spanish colony, played a major role in shaping attitudes and events in the southernmost British colonies. Moreover, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Florida was a battleground for many of the “big” issues in American history, including the struggle of Native Americans to protect themselves and their lands, the struggle of Africans and African Americans to free themselves from bond slavery, and questions about the limits of United States expansion.
